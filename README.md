# Economic_Analysis_of_Government_Spending
Analyze government spending data to explore patterns, relationships with GDP per capita growth across G20 economies, and its alignment with policy declarations and actual budgetary allocations. Further, investigate any additional associations between government spending and broader economic activity.

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze government spending data to identify trends, anomalies, misalignments, and economic impacts. It involves a multifaceted approach, including data cleaning, time-series analysis, sector-wise analysis, policy and spending misalignment analysis, economic impact assessment, and machine learning modeling.

## Project Overview

- **Data Collection and Cleaning:** We start by extracting government spending data from various sources and ensuring its cleanliness and consistency.

- **Data Analysis:** We analyze the data to gain insights into its characteristics and structure.

- **Time-Series Analysis:** Monthly and yearly time-series charts are constructed to visualize government spending over an extended period. These charts help us identify patterns or anomalies in spending data across different sectors.

- **Sector-Wise Analysis:** We conduct a sector-wise analysis to evaluate government spending within various sectors. This enables a comparison and contrast of spending trends across different sectors.

- **Policy and Spending Alignment:** We investigate the alignment between policy declarations, budget allocations, and actual spending. Identifying misalignments between policy and spending can highlight inefficiencies.

- **Economic Impact Analysis:** We explore the relationship between government spending and GDP per capita growth. This allows us to examine correlations or disparities between government spending and broader economic activity.

## Project Goals

- Understand government spending patterns.
- Identify anomalies or misalignments in spending data.
- Compare spending trends across different sectors.
- Assess the economic impact of government spending.
- Create machine learning models to predict future spending trends.
